Simple OpenSSL Port for AmigaOS
===============================

This is an interim solution for maintaining a recent 
version of OpenSSL for AmigaOS. The real (and not 
AmigaOS 4.x specific) solution is developed in form of 
AmiSSL at http://sourceforge.net/projects/amissl/

Building 
--------

Simply invoke the makefile. The only problem is that it 
does not work yet. This is WIP.

Patch management
----------------

Patches are maintained as in the adtools projects at 
https://github.com/sba1/adtools. In fact, a checkout of 
this repository is done as part of the makefile to 
download the current version of the scripts.
